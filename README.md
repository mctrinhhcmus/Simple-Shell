# Simple-Shell
This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. Your implementation will support input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. Completing this project will involve using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system calls and can be completed on Linux system.
